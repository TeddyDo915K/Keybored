# Build Guide

## Required Components
You will need the following tools and components to build the Basketweave (not included in the kit):
- Soldering iron and solder
- Phillips head screwdriver
- Flush side cutters
- No-clean flux (recommended to prevent bridging on USB pins)
- 68 MX style switches
- 5 PCB mount 2u stabilizers
- Keycaps (check compatibility, this layout uses many non-standard keys)
- USB Type C cable
## Included Components

### Step 1. Zener Diodes (D69, D70)
**This part has specific orientation** - black line on the diode lines up with the square pad (points left)

### Step 2. Resistors (R1-8)
Orientation does not matter. Solder based on the labeled values.
| Ref    | Value |
| ------ | ----- |
| R1, R7 | 1.5k  |
| R2, R5 | 5.1k  |
| R3, R4 | 75    |
| R6     | 10k   |

### Step 3. 1n1418 Diodes (D1-68, D71-72)
**This part has a specific orientation** - black line on the diode lines up with the square pad (points up)

### Step 4. Capacitors (C1-4)
Orientation does not matter. Solder based on the labeled values.
| Ref    | Value |
| ------ | ----- |
| C1, C2 | 22uF  |
| C3, C4 | 0.1uF |

### Step 5. USB Port
Solder one of the large legs first and check that the port is flush before soldering the other three legs. \
Solder the smaller pins by applying no-clean flux across the pins, then drag a small amount of solder across the pins until all the holes are filled.

### Step 6. Capacitor (C5)
**This part has a specific orientation** - longer leg goes in square pad (white mark on the capacitor points up)

### Step 7. Fuse
Orientation does not matter. Fold down after soldering.

### Step 10. Push Button (RESET, BOOT) and IC Socket
Push buttons have no specific orientation. \
Align the notch on the IC Socket with the markings on the PCB.
